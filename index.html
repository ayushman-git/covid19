                Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based
                hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

                When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid
                droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. You
                can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the
                person has the disease.

              <p>
                Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come
                into close contact with someone that has COVID-19 and it is more
                difficult to maintain physical distance of 2 metres (6 feet).

                Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough,
                headache, mild fever, until you recover.

                Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible
                COVID-19 and other viruses.
