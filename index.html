              </header>
              <p>
                Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause
                illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses
                are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the
                common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East
                Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory
                Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes
                coronavirus disease COVID-19.

                COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
                discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown
                before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
                COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally.

                How does Covid-19 spread?
              </header>
              <p>
                People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
                disease spreads primarily from person to person through small
                droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a
                person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets
                are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the
                ground. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these
                droplets from a person infected with the virus. This is why it
                is important to stay at least 1 meter) away from others. These
                droplets can land on objects and surfaces around the person such
                as tables, doorknobs and handrails. People can become infected
                by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes,
                nose or mouth. This is why it is important to wash your hands
                regularly with soap and water or clean with alcohol-based hand
                rub. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways that COVID-19
                is spread and will continue to share updated findings.

                How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is
                infected?
              </header>
              <p>
                Practicing hand and respiratory hygiene is important at ALL
                times and is the best way to protect others and yourself. When
                possible maintain at least a 1 meter distance between yourself
                and others. This is especially important if you are standing by
                someone who is coughing or sneezing. Since some infected persons
                may not yet be exhibiting symptoms or their symptoms may be
                mild, maintaining a physical distance with everyone is a good
                idea if you are in an area where COVID-19 is circulating.

                What is difference between self-isolation, self-quarantine and
                distancing?
              </header>
              <p>
                Quarantine means restricting activities or separating people who
                are not ill themselves but may have been exposed to COVID-19.
                The goal is to prevent spread of the disease at the time when
                people just develop symptoms. <br />Isolation means separating
                people who are ill with symptoms of COVID-19 and may be
                infectious to prevent the spread of the disease. <br />
                Physical distancing means being physically apart. WHO recommends
                keeping at least 1-metre distance from others. This is a general
                measure that everyone should take even if they are well with no
                known exposure to COVID-19.
